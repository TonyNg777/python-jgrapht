"""
Minimum Spanning Tree using Prim
================================

In this example we create an undirected graph and compute a minimum spanning tree 
(MST) using Prim's algorithm. The graph is constructed using the Watts-Strogatz model.
"""

# %%
# Start by importing the package

import jgrapht
import jgrapht.generators as gen
import jgrapht.algorithms.spanning as spanning
import random

# %%
# Creating a graph is done using the factory method. We create an undirected 
# graph with support for weights.

g = jgrapht.create_graph(directed=False, weighted=True)

# %%
# We use the Watts-Strogatz generator to populate a graph. We start with the 
# ring of 30 vertices each connected to its 4 nearest neighbors and rewiring with 
# probability 0.1.

gen.watts_strogatz_graph(g, 30, 4, 0.1, seed=17)


# %%
# We also assign some random weights from [0, 1) to the edges. 

rng = random.Random(17)
for e in g.edges: 
    g.set_edge_weight(e, rng.random())

# %%
# Let us print the graph

print(g)

# %%
# Then, we execute Prim's algorithm.

mst_weight, mst_tree = spanning.prim(g)

# %%
# The result is a tuple which contains the weight and the minimum spanning tree.
# 

print('mst weight: {}'.format(mst_weight))
print('mst tree: {}'.format(mst_tree))
